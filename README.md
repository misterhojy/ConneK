What is Connek?

Connek is a personal tool that will allow users to enhance their social network by organizing their contacts and keeping track of the last time the user has seen them. Users can Create Replace Update Delete contacts with their name, number, image, and more details. With many contacts, you can also create a group that would represent a certain friend group or a business network. The group will show each user their images and numbers and will have their name and image. Users can organize each contact or group with a tag and search for people in their network relating to that tag eg. Gym Tag. To keep track of the last time the user has seen a contact or group, the User can click the button signifying that User has seen the contact or the group in person. This will then reset the count of the last time seen (in days, weeks, or years). The count will increase each day until the User hits the "Connected" button. After hitting the button You have the option to add notes to the interaction which you can outline certain discussion topics or activities you have done with the contact/group. All these notes and times you have "connected" with a contact/group will be archived in a journal-like feature in each contact/group that shows a timeline of all the interactions. You may also send invitations to contacts/groups by pressing another button which will have a default message that can be changed and sent to iMessage, gmail, etc to the intended recipient. This application can be used for many different purposes, College Students and professional life. It is just an application to keep track of your network.
